			<p>These are my favorite players on the Dallas Cowboys. I have been a huge fan of the Dallas Cowboys since I started watching
			football with my dad all those years ago. This list is a short list of who made the cut as my favorites, there are so many more 
			but I thought 7 would be sufficient.<p>
			<p>Out of all of these players though my favorite is Dak Prescott. He is the Quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. His story 
			is incredible. He was drafted in the 4th round of the NFL Draft in 2016. He was going to be the 3rd String QB. But then Kellen Moore
			who is the 2nd string QB broke his ankle and then Tony Romo who is one of the greatest QB's in Cowboys History hurt his back in a game.
			Dak was thrust in sort of like a baptism by fire. And he killed it. He led the Cowboys to a 13-3 record and took over as the starter for the 
			foreseeable future.</p>
