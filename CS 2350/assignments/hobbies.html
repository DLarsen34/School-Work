			From the headers and table up above, my name is Dalton Larsen.<br>
			I enjoy playing video games with my brother and when I'm not doing that I'm hanging out with my beautiful fiance.<br>
			We are planning on getting married in the Brigham City Temple on December 29th of this year.<br>
			My favorite game to play with my brother is <a href="https://www.h1z1.com/king-of-the-kill/home"> H1Z1: King of the Kill (KotK)</a>. It's a battle royale type of game, kind of like Hunger Games.<br>

			One of the other hobbies that is fun to me is hanging out with friends. I have two really good friends from highschool. We were on the <br>
			<a href="https://www.mlb.com/" target ="_blank"> baseball</a> team together and have known each other since 7th grade. One of my friends just got married last Saturday and my other friend is <br>
			engaged to be married in May.

			My favorite artist/singer is Eminem, My favorite song by him is Infinite. It's one of his newest songs and will be on his next album. <br>
			I think his story is amazing, especially watching the movie 8 Mile which he stars in and is a documentary of his life and how he went from <br>
			a poor kid working in the car factories of Detroit to becoming one of the most successful Rappers in history.<br>
