		<h3> My favorite Movie </h3>
		<p>
			My favorite movie of all time is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watch_(2012_film)" target="_blank"><cite>The Watch</cite></a>. It stars Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, and Vince Vaughn.<br>
			It's about 4 friends who form a neighborhood watch group after a security guard is killed at the local Cost-Co.<br>
			They form the watch group to find the killer but find that the killer is not what they are expecting. <br>
			It's a scy-fy comedy and it's one of the funniest movies I've seen.

		<h3> My favorite TV Show </h3>
		<p>
			My favorite TV series is <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/" target="blank"><cite>Rick and Morty</cite></a>. It's currently on it's third season. I just started watching it recently, <br>
			a co-worker turned me on to it and it's pretty funny in my opinion. It's about a Grandfather who can travel to different <br>
			planets and dimensions and he takes his grandson Morty with him. It's also a sy-fy comedy.
