		<h3> Movies Page</h3>
		<p>
			The first page in my portfolio is about my favorite movies and TV shows that are 
			on TV right now. This page is the very first page I built in CS 2350. It was fun
			putting all the pictures in the page and creating the list to show everything about
			my favorite movies and TV shows.

		<h3>My Animation Page </h3>
		<p>
			This a page where I showcase how to do animation using CSS. This was HW6 in the class.
			It is a story about a pufferfish, a fish, and hook. It was actually a challanging assignment 
			because getting the positions and timing right was pretty challenging.

			final 2 years of high school. I played pitcher and was our number 1 pitcher. My 
			junior year we took 4th in state which is the 2nd best finish ever for our school's 
			baseball team. I met my best frineds through baseball and had a ton of fun with them.
